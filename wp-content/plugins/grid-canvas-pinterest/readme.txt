Pinterest and social media grid image creation tool. Create beautiful and engaging Pinterest and social media grid images right from your dashboard.

== Description ==

> Grid Canvas is in beta and is free to use while in beta.

Grid Canvas is an easy to use graphic design tool that helps you create beautiful grid images for your social media needs. Grid Canvas works directly from your WordPress dashboard. Every time you create a blog post or a page, Grid Canvas will automatically detect all the images from the post and add them to a beautiful grid layout. You can further do your own adjustments to make the image the way you like - you can add new images from the media library and drag each image to change its position. There are plenty of predefined grid layouts to choose from and there are more coming soon. You can also select the image size that is the most optimal for the different social networks - Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

When you are ready with your grid image design, the plugin will make a request to the Grid Canvas API to generate the image. The generated image is then stored in your Media Library and available for sharing on Pinterest, downloading or you can use it any other way.
